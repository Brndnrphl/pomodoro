# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a simple yet effective Pomodoro Timer. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that encourages people to work with the time they haveâ€”rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks.

## How it Works

The timer is set to 25 minutes by default. You can start, stop, and reset the timer with the respective buttons. When the time is up, a message will be displayed and an alarm will sound.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses Bootstrap for styling and jQuery for DOM manipulation.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: This file contains the structure of the web page. It includes the timer, start, stop, and reset buttons, and an audio element for the alarm.

- `styles.css`: This file contains the styles for the web page. It includes styles for the body, container, and buttons.

- `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code that controls the timer and buttons.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Click the "Start" button to start the timer. Click the "Stop" button to pause the timer. Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer back to 25 minutes.
